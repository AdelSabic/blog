  Hello Marek, I have been struggling so much.  Your description is easy to
  follow so thanks for that. I am getting the same problem as Martin. I get this
  message: “Confirm-MsolDomain : Unable to verify this domain because it is used
  elsewhere in Office 365. Remove the verified domain from the other service
  before adding it here.” I also checked and the TXT Record is set properly, so
  I have no clue, what is wrong :-(.  Any help would be much appreciated.
