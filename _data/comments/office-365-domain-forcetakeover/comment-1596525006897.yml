message: "Hey guys, sorry for the delay.\r\nUnfortunately the PS only works on unverified/unmanaged directories, meaning if you get the message its used elsewhere you have to remove it from there, either access the other tenant yourself(if you have credentials) or with help of Office 365 support, which can help you recover access to he tenant.\r\n\r\nThank you for your reactions."
