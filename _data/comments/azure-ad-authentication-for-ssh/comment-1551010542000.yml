  The point was to actually not having to use ADDS/Azure AD Domain Services at
  all and leverage modern authentication including conditional access and MFA
  which is not offered by any of the solutions you mentioned. Microsoft has
  already made their own implementation which allows you to do exactly this
  without having to have ADDS or AADDS -
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/login-using-aad
  and you simply assign permissions to that machine in the Azure Portal which is
  pretty cool. This was just an attempt to implement this before Microsoft built
  it on their own.
