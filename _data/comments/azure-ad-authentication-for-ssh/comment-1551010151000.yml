  AD login already works (and has been for years) with SSSD on Linux. Including
  sudo access controlled via AD sudoroles (the sudo source code actually
  includes the schema you need to extend AD with). If you don't have local AD,
  you can also use SSSD to join to Azure AD:

  So I'm not quite sure what you're trying to achieve here.
