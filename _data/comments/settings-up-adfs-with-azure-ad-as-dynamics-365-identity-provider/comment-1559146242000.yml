  I am challenged with step 2, "Configure the Application Identifier to your
  ADFSâ€™s address, for example: https://sts.crmlabs.tntg.cz"


  The Application Identifier does not appear to be editable (it is a GUID). The
  only way I can change this is to setup SAML authentication -- is that part of
  the process?
