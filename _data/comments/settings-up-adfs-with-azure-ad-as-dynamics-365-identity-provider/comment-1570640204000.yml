  I've been looking for this solution, although our situation is slightly
  different.  We are on a roadmap to get to the online version of Dynamics 365,
  but as interim step will be lifting our on-premise to an Azure Vnet.  The ADFS
  notes make sense, but your steps on the App creation are a bit unclear to me
  and I'm trying to match with the Azure Portal.  Do we create a Web App or are
  you talking about an App Registration within the Azure Active Directory
  service?  Thanks again for this article!
