  Hi Matt, what is your exact scenario? If you plan to combine CRM, Exchange and
  identity there it can be done in supported scenarios:

  Dynamics 365 on-premise to Exchange Online

  Dynamics 365 on-premise to Exchange on-premise

  Dynamics 365 online to Exchange on-premise

  Dynamics 365 online to Exchange online


  If you want to have a part of CRM in cloud and the rest onpremises, it can be
  done too.


  First you need to decide how toho split the workload. Kingswaysoft has a great
  solution for integrating environments. We have experimented with Virtual
  Entities for read only access.
