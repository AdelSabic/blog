  [&#8230;] In previous article, we have looked at the possibility to connect
  Dynamics 365 on-premise directly with Azure AD, which is on one hand really
  cool, on the other, it doesn&#8217;t provide all the features like mobile apps
  integration. In this article, we are going to explore a production ready
  solution by leveraging Active Directory Federation Service and Azure AD as a
  Claims Provider Trust. [&#8230;]
