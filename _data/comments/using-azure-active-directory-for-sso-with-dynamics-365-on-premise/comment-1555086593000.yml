  Your approach worked like a charm for me on my CRM 2011 instance, however
  since changing the configuration I can't connect to CRM via the API using the
  usual methods.  No matter what I try I get the "the authentication endpoint
  Username was not found on the configured Secure Token Service!"  I understand
  that I need to force it to use NameIdentifier, but I don't know what part of
  the code to change to force it to use that.  Any ideas?
