  Nice but where do you create the info "The simple solution was to create an
  SPF record for em2509.e-mail.thenetw.org which contains v=spf1
  include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:sendgrid.net
  include:u9317285.wl036.sendgrid.net -all Office 365 and SendGrid IPs."

  Since in the DNS there should already have a entry for em2509 (cname) that
  SendGrid need to have?


  We are using SendGrid but have problem sending to others Microsoft Tenant (as
  we also have a tenant) Microsoft re-route the mail...first time spf pass with
  our dedicated IP but the message header change after that and now use the
  Microsoft IP with our SendGrid emxxxx subdomain...spf then fail.
