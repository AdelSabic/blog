  Hello Andrew,

  you are absolutely right. We were discussing this with my colleagues and
  choose this option because of the limitation to one expand on
  retrieveMultipleRecords call. But what I didn't considered is FetchXML query
  instead of OData query. I haven't tested it, but it should work.


  So thanks for the comment.


  We use this method, because I think it's more pleasant for the customizers of
  Dynamics Solutions.


  When I get a little more time, I'll try to edit the post with your input.


  Thanks again.
