  Hey Jan,


  Awesome article, thank you for sharing this information with us.


  Following your step it worked perfect worked.


  Later I did some test and found out that without encoded URL too this can
  work,

  we can simply use decoded URL e.g below worked for me

  https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=/sites/sitename/Shared%20Documents/notebookname


  I have tested this in SharePoint Online so far and also noticed this works
  with Modern List experience only


  Thank you
