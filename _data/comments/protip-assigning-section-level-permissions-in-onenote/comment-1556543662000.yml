  Hi, I think that it actually makes difference because Class Notebook is using
  these permissions to secure the sections for students. So there might be some
  sync mechanism or something. I would suggest looking into the audit log on
  that specific folder (or enabling it first in Office 365) to gain some more
  insight into what happened.
