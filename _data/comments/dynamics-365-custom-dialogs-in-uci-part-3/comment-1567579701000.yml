  Hi František,


  Thank you for you great article!

  We implemented several custom dialogs with success.


  Now we are facing issue with implementation of "MultiSelect Option Set" custom
  control.

  We use the same XML configuration as for "Option Set" but we cannot see any
  list of values.


  Have you ever implemented "MultiSelect Option Set"? If so, can you share with
  us some hints or code examples?


  Thank you so much!


  Best Regards


  Radek
