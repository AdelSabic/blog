message: "Frantisek,  It seems like when I change the incoming email address on the Queue, the email address on the mailbox is set to the same email address  and vice-versa.  do you know anything about this?  i would like to use a distribution list so that all team members receive the team emails.  \r\n\r\nQueue - incoming email\r\nMailBox - email\r\n\r\nAre they not separate fields?"
