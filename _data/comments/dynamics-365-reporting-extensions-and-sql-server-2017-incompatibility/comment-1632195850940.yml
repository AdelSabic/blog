message: "Unfortunately that blog has gone down, but after many hours of searching this entry helped me get past the problem of having it not visible on SSRS 2017\r\n\r\nhttps://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/microsoft-dynamics-crm-forum/411171/getting-error-while-installing-microsoft-dynamic-crm-365-v9-reporting-extension\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWith the RTM version of the reporting extensions for Dynamics 365 -- there was an issue as it related to finding the SSRS instance name with SSRS 2017. The SSRS team changed the location in the registry that previously stored the instance name, and the installer for Dynamics 365 reporting extensions was not referencing the new location. This has been addressed in a later update for the reporting extensions installer -- microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58153\r\n\r\nHowever, the 0.3 update is not a stand-alone installer. So, there are steps needed here to slipstream the install to include 0.3 with the RTM bits and allow the selection of the reporting services instance name to complete.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to remove the manually added registry entries for the SSRS instance, slipstream the install, and then you should be able to select the SSRS instance name from the drop down selection in the reporting extensions setup. Here is a summary of the steps to slipstream the 0.3 update into the RTM install for the Dynamics 365 SSRS reporting extensions:\r\n\r\nCopy the SSRS reporting extensions folder from the RTM bits of Dynamics 365 V9 on premise and paste on the SSRS server in a directory such as:  c:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\r\nIf you don't have the RTM bits, download the server package from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57478\r\nAfter downloading the .exe, you can extract the contents by command line\r\nCRM9.0-Server-ENU-amd64.exe /extract:c:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\r\nDownload the 0.3 update for SSRS reporting extensions from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58153\r\nFile named: CRM9.0-Srs-KB4490599-ENU-Amd64.exe\r\nExtract the contents of this file using command line: CRM9.0-Srs-KB4490599-ENU-Amd64.exe /extract:c:\\installMedia\\SSRSExtUpdate\r\nThere should now be two directories extracted on the SSRS server:\r\nc:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\\SrsDataConnector -- containing the RTM bits\r\nC:\\installMedia\\SSRSExtUpdate -- containing the 0.3 SSRS reporting extension update bits\r\nEdit the install-config.xml file in notepad from the c:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\\SrsDataConnector directory\r\nChange the <patch update=\"false\"></patch> line to:\r\n<Patch update=\"true\">C:\\installMedia\\SSRSExtUpdate\\Srs_KB4490599_amd64_1033.msp</Patch>\r\nSave the file\r\nRun the install against the RTM bits of the SRS Reporting Extensions using Command prompt and the /config parameter\r\nOpen Command prompt, change directory to the location of the RTM SSRS Reporting extensions media\r\nCd c:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\\SrsDataConnector\r\nRun the SetupSrsDataConnector.exe with the /config parameter pointing to the install-config.xml file:\r\nSetupSrsDataConnector.exe /config c:\\installMedia\\CRMV9RTM\\SrsDataConnector\\install-config.xml\r\nThe above steps will then push the 0.3 update into the RTM install and you should be able to select the reporting services instance name on the SSRS 2017 server. (make sure you are installing the reporting extensions for Dynamics 365 on the server where SSRS is installed and not on the Dynamics 365 server)"
