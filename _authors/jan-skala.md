I started programming when I was at elementary school. It was more like block programming, a software called Baltík.
I learned some basics: conditions, loops, coordinates, algorithms and stuff like that. Then
I switched to C# and started doing desktop apps. When I started working in TheNetw.org I discovered a
framework DotVVM. Through that I started experimenting with web apps. It really helped me to get around basics
of web development without taking deep dives into JavaScript, which I did later anyway. Today I focus on
creating web API’s or other backend services. I enjoy working with Azure and building cloud solutions, taking
advantage of serverless solutions like Logic Apps or Azure Functions.
